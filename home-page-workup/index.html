        <h1> Portfolio</h1>
        <h2>About Me:</h2>
        <p> Hello! My name is Sage Howard, and this is a portfolio of my work.  I am currently a student at the University
            of North Carolina at Chapel Hill studying Sociology and Studio Art. This site will have work relating
            to my studies in sociology as well as my work in studio art. In addition to this I am currently learning 
            HTML,CSS, and JavaScript in my free time, in fact this is the first true webpage I am making that will 
            hopefully have javascript functionality.
            
        </p>
        <h2>About My Art:</h2>
        <p> I do watercolor paintings, that usually focus on plowers, plants, or natural scenery. In addition to my work 
            with watercolors I also work with clay making ceramics. I usually prefer to throw on the wheel, but I do 
            also do some hand built work. I also have some digital illustrations, but most of them are from 
            quite a while ago since I don't typically do them unless I have a reason or want to make somethings that
            I can't make physically. I'm sure that while at school I wil dabble in more art forms, so I will make sure
            to keep this updated with whatever I am working on.
        </p>
