    <p>In the field of sociology there are many different methods that
         sociologists use when conducting research. The most common research 
         methodologies in sociology are</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Experiments</li>
        <li>Surveys</li>
        <li>Participant/Direct Observation</li>
        <li>Content Analysis</li>
        <li>Unobtrusive Observation</li>
    </ul>
    <P>Experiments are one of the least common methods used as they are usually
        very hard to get approved by the institution overseeing the research. They
        are however the best way to learn how much of a change in y is due to the
        presence of y. Experiments accomplish this because they are able to remove
        other variables that may interfere with or skew the results of the research.
    </P>
    <p>Surveys are a very common way to conduct research. They are able to provide a good sample size, 
        that is random to an extent. They do have the problem of limiting what people can learn about the population
        due to the limited amount of questions and details that can be gathered from the survey. The most
        common way that surveys are used is to purchase them and use the data that was already collected by the surveys creator.</p>
        
     <p>Participant/Direct Observation involves researchers observing their subject without the subjects knowing they are being observed.
        This allows researchers to investigate human behavior without the subjects altering their behavior because they know they are being studied.
        This can include things such as people watching in public areas or even studying groups by attending their events or joining them. This is a common
        way to study group behavior or to see what people do when they do not think anyone is paying attention or watching.
    </p>

    <p>Content Analysis is often used when studying media or marketing. When using this method the researcher will analyze and study
        the content of a particular type of media. One example would be studying food commercials on TV at dinner time or studying when sleeping pill ads are
        played on TV. Essentially researchers look at a narrow band of content and look at different aspects of it for their research.
    </p>

    <p>Unobtrusive Observation is a method where researcher analyze the signs and indicators of human behavior that pertain to their research. For example
        this could include going through the trash of a certain area to learn about the buying habits of the area. It can also look like someone studying food preferences
        would analyze what kind of food is left in the cafeteria after meals. This method involves looking at the byproducts of human behavior to make conclusions about hte behavior themselves.
